I obtained PhD from University of Cambridge. My current research interests focus on improving the out-of-distribution generalization ability for large vision language model (LVLM) and embodied AI. We are devoted to solve the fundamental challenge of the generalization ability of machine learning systems. I serve as programme committee members and reviewers for several key machine learning journals and conferences. Our lab has published several papers on top machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, IJCAI, etc.
